For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
And all for the want of a nail.
For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
For want of a shoe the horse was lost.
For want of a horse the rider was lost.
For want of a rider the message was lost.
For want of a message the battle was lost.
For want of a battle the kingdom was lost.
And all for the want of a nail.
And all for the want of a nail.
For want of a nail the shoe was lost.
And all for the want of a nail.
For want of a pin the gun was lost.
For want of a gun the soldier was lost.
For want of a soldier the battle was lost.
And all for the want of a pin.
